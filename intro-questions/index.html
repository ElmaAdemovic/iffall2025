        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p><b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b> 
            <br>Elma Ademovic, ComDes, Junior</p>

        <p><b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b>
            <br>As a ComDes major moreso interested in illustration, I’m not particularly familiar with coding but understand its importance and necessity in the field of design.</p>        
        
        <p><b>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b>
            <br>Not particularly, we did a small HTML article test in Typography I, but nothing major.</p>

        <p><b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b>
            <br>One thing I hope to learn is how to combine function and “flair,” making both a working site while still having it be interesting visually.
        </p>

        <p><b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b>
            <br>One way I expect screen design to differ from paper design is the scaling of the screen size. Paper typically requires a single or minimal amount of sizes for a design, while a website would need proper scaling for any size window.
        </p>

        <p><b>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b>
        <br><a href="https://ollivere.co/" target="_blank">ollivere.co</a>
        <br>Martin Ollivere’s design site was one I stumbled upon a few years ago and has stuck with me ever since. His use of interactive illustrations with the type as you scroll through the page makes it incredibly memorable and informative to the kind of work he does. 
        </p>

        <p><b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b>
            <br><a href=https://www.lisakeene.com/index.html target="_blank">lisakeene.com</a>
            <br>While it’s a rather older website, Lisa Keene’s portfolio site is simple and straightforward. The different kinds of art are all tabbed at the top, her featured work are clickable buttons at the bottom, and there are preview images to all her pieces for easy viewing. 
            </p>

        <p><b>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b>
            <br><a href=https://www.target.com target="_blank">target.com</a>
            <br>Both visually appealing and accessible, Target’s site does a great job at showing what kinds of products and deals are currently happening while keeping a focus on branding and an overarching design system.
