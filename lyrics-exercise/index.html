            <h2>Will Wood</h2>
                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Verse 1]</span>
				<br>I could drink your blood if you let me, baby
				<br>Hang from your rafters, patchwork and paisley
				<br>I could suck you dry on the rocks with a twist
				<br>But just like a vampire, I don't exist
         
                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Pre-Chorus 1]</span>
                <br>Walkie-talkie static, white noise telepath
                <br>Can you read between the Morse code lines?
                <br>Dead from the neck up, but living just enough
                <br>To beg you, "pretty boy, please, let me die"

                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Chorus]</span>
                <br>Well, I could drink your blood if you let me, baby
                <br>Drain you of your love until you hate me

                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Verse 2]</span>
                <br>Mm, I could take your life, if you're done with it, sweetheart
                <br>You still picking at that? Only ate the good parts
                <br>Hey, whatever works, I'm a cheap date (Check, please!)
                <br>Falling off the bone, I'm awful-glad we met

                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Pre-Chorus 2]</span>
                <br>We only ever notice what's in front of us
                <br>Read over my shoulder, breathing down my neck
                <br>Are we on the same page yet? I'm getting old here
                <br>Come on, don't you get it? What the heck?

                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Chorus]</span>
                <br>Oh, I could drink your blood if you let me, baby
                <br>Drain you of your love until you hate me


                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Bridge]</span>               
                <br>Yes, to err is human, so don't be one
 				<br>This was a mistake, I'll take my leave
 				<br>But, before I go, let me know if you see
 				<br>A little black bag with a toe tag, please
 				<br>If you don't hate me, then reanimate me
 				<br>Prove it to me, baby, lightning in my veins
 				<br>These instincts I've managed to stave mean
 				<br>Monsters must be people too, so oh geez!

                <p><span style="color: gray;">[Outro]</span>
                <br>Oh, I could drink your blood if you let me, baby
				<br>Drain you of your love until you hate me
				<br>I will drink your blood 'till your lips turn blue
				<br>Drain you of your love, if you want me to</p>
