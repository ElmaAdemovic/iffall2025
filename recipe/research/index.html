        <h3>Recipe Websites</h3>
        <ol><li><a href="https://bakewithzoha.com/" target="_blank">Baking with Zoha</a> - On Zoha's recipes, she includes an overview of the recipe at the bottom of each dish, including an ingredient list that has actual buttons you can check off. This was a really unique piece of site design that I found very helpful when making sure I didn't forget any ingredients.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cookingclassy.com/" target="_blank">Cooking Classy</a> - For this site, one thing I really enjoyed was its use of images. Each recipe on the home page has an image to show how the item looks, as well as has photos for directions; allowing the viewer to have an easy baking experience. </li>
       <li><a href="https://www.joyofbaking.com/" target="_blank">Joy of Baking</a> - Joy of Baking, similar to what we are using, uses html to make their site. This simple layout gave me great inspiration on how I can use similar layouts to make everything on the home page easy for the viewer to understand.</li></ol>

        <h3>Non-Recipe Websites</h3>
        <ol><li><a href="https://www.pantone.com/ " target="_blank">Pantone</a> - Pantone’s site, as a color based company, noticeably uses color effectively as it needs to show a variety of colors on the website. To do this, most of the non-images in the site design are black or white, in order for the colors to not overwhelm the viewer. </li>
            <li><a href="https://spencergabor.work/ " target="_blank">Spencer Gabor</a> - Spencer’s work intrigued me especially due to how much it differs from Pantone’s approach to communicative, yet non-overwhelming site design. Most every image, despite there being a lot of kinds of imagery, follows a strict color palette. This color palette is so strong that you can even change the site color at the bottom and the images still work with the new background.</li>
       <li><a href="https://tenyears.source.paris/en/?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=muzli" target="_blank">Ten Years of Source</a> - This site does a great job of explaining things when it breaks Jakob’s Law. For example, if you scroll down a bit, your cursor turns into an orange circle that says “Drag,” showing that you can now drag the background to see new things, even when it doesn’t seem like you could.</li></ol>
